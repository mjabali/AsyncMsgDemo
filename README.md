Asynchronous Mobile Messaging Demo
==================================

Oracle MAF Asynchronous Messaging Demo

###Goal:
The goal of this demo code is to show you how to use HTML5 WebSocket asynchronous messaging with Oracle Mobile Application Framework. There are many ways to demonstrate these capabilities and here we illustrate one of them with a combination of MAF AMX page, Java bean and JavaScript.

###Version:
Developed and tested with JDeveloper 12c (12.1.3.0.0)

###How to use it:
Download or clone this repo, open it up in JDeveloper 12c and deploy to simulator/emulator/device of your choice.
This repo contains the mobile application source code and doesn't provide the server side of it. You can easily setup a WebSocket server with Oracle WebLogic 12c.

###To Do:
Add server side code to this demo.

Have fun!
